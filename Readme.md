# expression

  Execute a JS expression in a context

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install ripplejs/expression

## API

```js
var exp = new Expression("one + (two * one)");

var result = exp.exec({
  two: 10,
  one: 2
});

assert(result === 22);
```

Create a new Expression, passing in a string.

```js
var exp = new Expression("one + (two * one)");
```

Execute this expression using a given context. For example, this expression
above depends on the variables `one` and `two`. So we can pass in an object
with these properties.

```js
var result = exp.exec({
  two: 10,
  one: 2
});
```

## Properties

### .props

Returns the properties used in the expression
